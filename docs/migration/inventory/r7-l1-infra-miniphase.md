# R7 L1 Infra Mini-Phase

> Generated: 2026-05-07
> Rule: every L1 claim is contrasted against C++ under `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy/src/server/`.

## Scope

This mini-phase closes the R4 `L1_INFRA` gate enough to unblock packet and map work without hiding the full database/DB2 surface:

- `wow-database`: statement ownership, prepared SQL registry, typed DB separation.
- `wow-data`: DB2/WDC4 loaders and hotfix overlay path.
- `world-server`/`wow-world`: runtime consumers use the correct L1 database/store instead of ad-hoc cross-DB reads.

## Tasks

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.INFRA.001.a** Move hotfix control SQL to `HotfixDatabase` and preload hotfix overlays at startup.
  C++ refs: `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy/src/server/game/DataStores/DB2Stores.cpp:1539`, `:1609`, `:1661`.
  Rust targets: `crates/wow-database/src/statements/hotfix.rs`, `crates/wow-data/src/hotfix_cache.rs`, `crates/world-server/src/main.rs`, `crates/wow-world/src/handlers/character.rs`.
  Acceptance: `hotfix_data`, `hotfix_blob`, and `hotfix_optional_data` are owned by `HotfixDatabase`; `CMSG_DB_QUERY_BULK` no longer queries `hotfix_blob` via `WorldDatabase`; tests pass for `wow-database`, `wow-data`, and `world-server`.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.INFRA.001.b** Refine prepared-statement closure by DB/runtime blocker.
  C++ refs: `docs/migration/inventory/r3-database-registry.md`, `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy/src/server/database/Database/Implementation/*.cpp`.
  Acceptance: the 1461 prepared statements are split into executable subtasks by owner DB and runtime dependency, with no optimistic “covered” marker unless SQL is registered and tested.
  Result from R3 inventory was refined into owner batches; CharacterDatabase and HotfixDatabase are now covered at the prepared-statement layer, with direct named variants preferred when runtime code consumes a statement.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.INFRA.001.c** Refine DB2 store closure.
  C++ refs: `docs/migration/inventory/r3-database-registry.md`, `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy/src/server/game/DataStores/DB2Stores.cpp`.
  Acceptance: current hand-written stores, hotfix overlay, and deferred generated DB2 stores are explicitly separated so later Maps/Entities tasks cannot assume missing stores exist.
  Result from R3 inventory was refined into DB2 store batches; Rust now has typed readers for all 325 C++ `DB2Storage` exact-file stores. Runtime consumer wiring and hotfix overlays remain downstream owner work.

## Follow-Up Work Items

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER** Split the missing C++ `CharacterDatabase` prepared statements into boot/login/save/social/guild/mail/auction/instance batches.
  Result: live extraction found 523 C++ `PrepareStatement(CHAR_...)` entries; Rust now covers all 523 at the prepared-statement layer via direct statements plus generated C++ SQL support. Runtime subsystem usage remains owned by Player/Mail/Guild/Auction/Quest/etc.
  Batch plan: `docs/migration/inventory/r7-l1-character-prep-batches.md` and `.tsv`.
- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.HOTFIX** Split or generate HotfixDatabase per-table statements from C++ `HotfixDatabase.cpp`/`DB2LoadInfo.h`; `#NEXT.L1.INFRA.001.a` only covers DB2Manager control queries.
  Result: C++ has 745 generated enum entries; Rust has 12 direct DB2 hotfix entries plus 3 DB2Manager control statements; generated support now covers all 325 C++ base statements, all 325 max-id statements and all 95 locale macros. Runtime hotfix overlay application remains owned by DB2 consumers.
  Batch plan: `docs/migration/inventory/r7-l1-hotfix-prep-batches.md` and `.tsv`.
- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB2.STORES** Define DB2 store implementation order: minimal runtime stores for Maps/Entities first, then full generated 325-store plan.
  Result: C++ declares 325 `DB2Storage` files; Rust now has 325 exact DB2 filename references matching C++ stores, all implemented as typed readers and fixture-open tested.
  Batch plan: `docs/migration/inventory/r7-l1-db2-store-batches.md` and `.tsv`.
- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB2.STORES.001_MAPS_WORLD** Implement typed DB2 readers for the 16 Maps/World exact-file gaps.
  Result: `crates/wow-data/src/maps_world.rs` covers C++ `DB2Structure.h`/`DB2LoadInfo.h`/`DB2Metadata.h` field shapes and opens every present fixture file in tests.
  Parking: downstream L3 consumers still own runtime wiring and hotfix overlays where C++ `DB2Manager` reads field-level data.
- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB2.STORES.002_ENTITIES_MOVEMENT** Implement typed DB2 readers for the 14 Entities/Movement exact-file gaps.
  Result: `crates/wow-data/src/entities_movement.rs` covers C++ `DB2Structure.h`/`DB2LoadInfo.h`/`DB2Metadata.h` field shapes and opens every present fixture file in tests.
  Parking: downstream L4/L5 consumers still own runtime wiring and hotfix overlays where C++ reads field-level data.
- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB2.STORES.003_ITEMS_COLLECTIONS** Implement typed DB2 readers for item/collection exact-file gaps.
  Result: `crates/wow-data/src/item_equipment.rs` covers the equipment/armor/damage/durability subbatch; `crates/wow-data/src/item_bonus.rs` covers the bonus/level-selector/limit/name/set/spec subbatch; `crates/wow-data/src/item_collections.rs` covers the economy/collection/cosmetic/battle-pet subbatch; `crates/wow-data/src/artifact_azerite.rs` covers artifact/azerite. All open every present fixture file in tests.
  Remaining: no live item/collection exact-file gaps remain in this scope.
- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB2.STORES.004_PLAYER_SPELLS_PROGRESSION** Implement typed DB2 readers for player/spell/progression exact-file gaps.
  Result: `crates/wow-data/src/character_progression.rs` covers character/class/race/customization/power/namegen; `crates/wow-data/src/trait_tree.rs` covers trait tree; `crates/wow-data/src/progression_rewards.rs` covers quest/reward/criteria/faction/curve/scaling; `crates/wow-data/src/skill_talent.rs` covers skill/talent/PvP/glyph/journal; `crates/wow-data/src/spell_db2.rs` covers all 38 scoped `Spell*` stores. All open every present fixture file in tests.
  Remaining: no exact-file gaps remain in this scope; downstream runtime tasks still own consumer wiring and hotfix overlay behavior where C++ reads field-level data.
- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB2.STORES.005_MISC_GENERATED** Implement typed DB2 readers for the remaining generated/misc exact-file gaps.
  Result: `crates/wow-data/src/misc_generated.rs` covers all 59 remaining stores, including Garrison, text/config/cinematic/language/holiday/PvP/scenario/sound/script/misc stores. All open every present fixture file in tests.
  Remaining: no C++ DB2Storage exact-file gaps remain; downstream runtime tasks still own consumer wiring and hotfix overlay behavior where C++ reads field-level data.
- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.MAP_SPAWNS** Add map-spawn prepared SQL and the runtime spawn index needed by Maps.
  C++ refs: `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy/src/server/game/Globals/ObjectMgr.cpp:2167`, `:2449`, `:2492`; `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy/src/server/game/Globals/AreaTriggerDataStore.cpp:312`.
  Rust targets: `crates/wow-database/src/statements/world.rs`, `crates/wow-map/src/spawn.rs`.
  Acceptance: creature/gameobject/areatrigger spawn SQL is global preload SQL, not per-cell SQL; `SpawnStore` indexes creature/gameobject GUIDs exactly like `ObjectMgr::AddSpawnDataToGrid`, including personal phase variant; static areatriggers use the non-personal `AreaTriggerDataStore` location index.
