# R7 L1 Character Prepared Statement Batches

> Generated: 2026-05-14
> Rule: every batch is derived from `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy/src/server/database/Database/Implementation/CharacterDatabase.cpp`.

## Source Counts

- C++ `CharacterDatabase` prepared statements: 523.
- Rust prepared-statement coverage in `crates/wow-database/src/statements/character.rs`: 523 via direct statements plus generated C++ SQL support.
- Missing C++ statements after current Rust coverage: 0 at the prepared-statement layer; subsystem runtime usage remains owned by Player/Mail/Guild/Auction/Quest/etc.

The older R3 count of 511 missing statements is superseded by this live count. The source of truth remains the C++ `PrepareStatement(CHAR_...)` list; Rust aliases that intentionally cover a C++ statement must be recorded in the owning batch before marking it complete.

## Batches

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.001_BOOT_ENUM_ACCOUNT**: 59 statements.
  Scope: account/character list, create/delete/rename/customize, bans, free-name, GM ticket cleanup, game-event/world-state/account-data maintenance.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; runtime use remains limited to consumed blockers.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.002_LOGIN_LOAD**: 18 statements.
  Scope: player load root selects, customizations, group/guild membership, corpse/respawn/instance-time reads.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; canonical Player load remains a runtime task.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.003_PLAYER_PROGRESSION**: 81 statements.
  Scope: action bars, achievements/criteria, reputation, skills, spells, cooldowns/charges, talents, glyphs, traits, currency, equipment/transmog sets.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; progression semantics remain owner tasks.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.004_INVENTORY_ITEMS**: 27 statements.
  Scope: item instances, inventory, gifts, refunds, item loot containers, void storage, BOP trade, gems/transmog item adjuncts.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; item ownership/runtime remains a Player storage task.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.005_QUESTS**: 36 statements.
  Scope: active/rewarded quest status, objectives, criteria progress, daily/weekly/monthly/seasonal reset/save/delete.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; quest semantics remain owner tasks.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.006_MAIL**: 24 statements.
  Scope: mailbox list/read, mail items, expiry, return, delete, receiver/item owner updates.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; full mail subsystem remains a later runtime task.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.007_AUCTION**: 21 statements.
  Scope: auction rows, auction items, bidders and black-market auctions.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; no runtime mutation before auction subsystem.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.008_GUILD**: 60 statements.
  Scope: guild, ranks, members, bank tabs/items/events, guild achievements/criteria, petition signatures.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; guild management runtime remains separate.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.009_GROUP_INSTANCE**: 50 statements.
  Scope: group rows, group members, battleground random/data, arena team, calendar/channel, instance locks/respawns.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; Map/Instance gates own first consumers.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.010_PETS**: 45 statements.
  Scope: character pets, pet auras/effects, spells, cooldowns, spell charges, declined names and stable/load/save/delete.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; pet runtime remains blocked on Player/Unit/Pet.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.CHARACTER.011_STATE_MISC**: 61 statements.
  Scope: aura stored locations, character social rows, corpse state, homebind, PvP stats, war mode tuning, online/zone/position/taxi/at-login updates.
  Acceptance: generated C++ SQL support covers the scoped statements exactly; runtime integration remains owner-scoped.

Prepared coverage note: `CharStatements::cpp(sql)` is verified against all 523 C++ `PrepareStatement(CHAR_...)` calls, including expansion of `SelectItemInstanceContent`. Batch counts remain subsystem ownership slices, not separate hand-written enum counts.

## Execution Rules

- Prefer direct named variants for statements consumed by runtime code; generated C++ SQL support is valid for prepared-statement parity and parked subsystem coverage.
- Every new Rust statement must include the C++ SQL body or a documented equivalent with table/column parity.
- Every batch closure must run `cargo test -p wow-database`; runtime batches also run their owner crate tests.
- Do not mark `#NEXT.L1.INFRA.001` complete until Character, Hotfix and DB2 store follow-ups are either implemented or explicitly parked with blockers.
