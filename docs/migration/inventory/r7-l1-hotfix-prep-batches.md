# R7 L1 Hotfix Prepared Statement Batches

> Generated: 2026-05-14
> Rule: every batch is derived from `/home/server/woltk-trinity-legacy/src/server/database/Database/Implementation/HotfixDatabase.h` and `.cpp`.

## Source Counts

- C++ `HotfixDatabaseStatements` enum entries: 745.
- Rust direct C++-name DB2 statement coverage: 745 via direct statements plus generated base/max-id/locale support.
- Rust DB2Manager control statements not present in the generated C++ enum: 3 (`HOTFIX_SEL_HOTFIX_DATA`, `HOTFIX_SEL_HOTFIX_BLOB`, `HOTFIX_SEL_HOTFIX_OPTIONAL_DATA`).
- Missing direct C++ hotfix statements after current coverage: 0 at the prepared-statement layer; runtime hotfix overlay application remains owned by DB2 consumers.

The generated C++ file uses the invariant `BASE`, `BASE_MAX_ID`, `BASE_LOCALE` for many stores. Rust must preserve that relationship when generating or adding table statements.

## Batches

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.HOTFIX.001_MAX_ID_GENERATED**: 325 statements.
  Scope: all `*_MAX_ID` statements produced by C++ `PREPARE_MAX_ID_STMT`.
  Acceptance: `HotfixStatements::max_id(table)` emits `SELECT MAX(ID) + 1 FROM <table>`; parity test extracts all 325 C++ `PREPARE_MAX_ID_STMT` entries and verifies generated SQL for each.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.HOTFIX.002_LOCALE_GENERATED**: 95 statements.
  Scope: all `*_LOCALE` statements produced by C++ `PREPARE_LOCALE_STMT`.
  Acceptance: `HotfixStatements::locale(table, columns)` emits the C++ locale SQL shape; parity test extracts all 95 C++ `PREPARE_LOCALE_STMT` entries and verifies generated SQL with matching columns/order.
  Note: `HOTFIX_SEL_NAMES_RESERVED_LOCALE` is a base statement for `NamesReservedLocale.db2`, not a generated locale statement for `NamesReserved.db2`.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.HOTFIX.003_MAPS_WORLD**: 26 base statements.
  Scope: map/world-facing DB2 tables: area, map, phase, liquid/light/world/taxi/transport/location-style consumers.
  Acceptance: generated base hotfix statement support covers the scoped C++ SQL exactly; runtime overlay wiring remains downstream.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.HOTFIX.004_ENTITIES_MOVEMENT**: 11 base statements.
  Scope: creature display/model, animation, vehicle/unit/NPC movement-facing hotfix stores.
  Acceptance: generated base hotfix statement support covers the scoped C++ SQL exactly; runtime overlay wiring remains downstream.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.HOTFIX.005_ITEMS_COLLECTIONS**: 92 base statements.
  Scope: item, armor/weapon/import price, mount, toy, transmog, heirloom, battle pet, artifact/azerite/garrison/auction-facing stores.
  Acceptance: generated base hotfix statement support covers the scoped C++ SQL exactly; runtime overlay wiring remains downstream.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.HOTFIX.006_PLAYER_SPELLS_PROGRESSION**: 88 base statements.
  Scope: spells, talents, skills, PvP, quests, factions, criteria/achievement, curves, specializations, race/class/player scaling stores.
  Acceptance: generated base hotfix statement support covers the scoped C++ SQL exactly; runtime overlay wiring remains downstream.

- [x] **#NEXT.L1.DB.PREP.HOTFIX.007_MISC_BASE**: 95 base statements.
  Scope: remaining base hotfix stores not owned by the runtime-first batches.
  Acceptance: generated base hotfix statement support covers the remaining C++ SQL exactly; runtime overlay wiring remains downstream.

Base coverage note: `HotfixStatements::base(sql)` is verified against all 325 C++ base `PrepareStatement(HOTFIX_SEL_...)` calls. The batch counts above remain ownership slices for consumers, not separate hand-written enum counts.

## Execution Rules

- Prefer generation from C++/DB2 metadata over hand-writing 733 statement arms.
- Generated SQL must preserve C++ table name, selected column order and `WHERE (\`VerifiedBuild\` > 0) = ?` semantics unless a file-loader path is explicitly chosen.
- Do not close `#NEXT.L1.DB2.STORES` by adding SQL alone; a statement without a typed DB2 store remains infrastructure-only.
